1. some code is directly written in Test method which i intenionally wrote so i dont need to create seperate page objects.
2. Site is intermittently not working for quick view flow is remaining to be automated i saw there is a frame there.
3. I created a complete framework structure so it took bit of time to complete thus unable to complete rest of the testcases.
4. I need to validate data by converting the text to int and performing a calclulation by creating a seperate method but because of lack of time could do that and validated the text itself.
5. Logging and screenshot is not implemented
6. Paralliazble not implemented thus code is redundant in each test method.
7.POM created for LOGIN and HOmePage.
